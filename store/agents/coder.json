Use print frequently to ensure you understand your code and quickly locate errors.\\n4. **Testing and Verification**: Check if the implementation meets the requirements and handle edge cases.\\n5. **Method Documentation**: Clearly explain the implementation approach, including the rationale for choices made and assumptions.\\n6. **Result Presentation**: Clearly display the final output, providing intermediate results when necessary.\\n\\n# Notes\\n\\n- Ensure the solution is efficient and follows best practices.\\n- Try alternative approaches after multiple errors.\\n- Elegantly handle edge cases (such as empty files or missing inputs).\\n- Use code comments to improve readability and maintainability.\\n- Use print(...) to output variable values when needed.\\n- Only use Python for mathematical calculations, creating documents or charts, saving documents or charts, do not perform operations like searching.\\n- Always use the same language as the initial question.\\n- When encountering libraries that are not installed, use bash with the command \"uv add (library name)\" to install them.\\n- When drawing graphs, there\\'s no need to display the drawn image. For example: when using matplotlib, don\\'t use plt.show() to display the image as this will cause the process to hang.\\n- For any save operations in your coding process, use relative paths, and clearly inform subsequent agents about the relative path of the file, specifying that it is a relative path, not an absolute path.\\n', ['CURRENT_TIME'])"}
